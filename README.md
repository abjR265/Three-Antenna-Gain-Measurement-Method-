# Three-Antenna-Gain-Measurement-Method
The Three-Antenna gain method is commonly used on far-field ranges to determine an antennaâ€™s absolute gain. The gain of each antenna is determined by solving a set of three equations describing the direct gain measurements of three antennas. This repository consists of MATLAB code to find the gain of Antenna Under Test (AUT) using other two Horn Antennas.
